## Data Dictionary
- Age -> Patient's age
- Female -> Binary variable that indicates whether the patient is female
- LOS (Length of stay) -> Patient's length of stay
- Race -> Patient's race
- Totchg -> Cost of hospitalization
- Aprdrg -> Patient Refined Diagnosis Group


## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. How many races are represented in the dataset?
2. What is the average age of patients?
3. What is the patient's age mode?
4. What is the age column variance?
5. What is the total expenditure on hospitalizations by age?
6. Which age generates the highest total expenditure on hospital admissions?
7. What is the total expenditure on hospitalizations by gender?
8. What is the average cost of hospital admissions by patient's race?
9. For patients over 10 years old, what is the average total expenditure on hospital admissions?
10. Considering the previous item, which age has an average of spending over 3000?


## Business Questions
1. What is the age distribution of patients seen at the hospital?
2. Which age group has the highest total hospital expenditure?
3. Which diagnostic-based group (Aprdrg) has the highest total hospital spend?
4. Does the patient's race relate to the total spent on hospital admissions?
5. Does the combination of age and sex of patients influence the total expenditure on hospitalizations?
6. As length of stay is the crucial factor for inpatients, we wanted to find out if length of stay can be defined by age, gender and race.
7. Which variables have the greatest impact on hospitalization costs?
